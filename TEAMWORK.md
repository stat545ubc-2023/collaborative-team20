Guidelines on how we will work together

Division of Labour: Part 1, 4 and 5 will be completed individually

How will you divide the work required for this milestone? Be sure to include what work will be done individually, so that the work in each teammate’s pull request has been identified.
Timing:

When will you each aim to submit your pull requests, keeping in mind that another teammate will need to review your work? Warning: Do not submit your part of the project last-minute. Your teammate’s review of your work may not be trivial: if there are errors, your team will need time to debug them.
Communication: We will aim to communicate with each other via Slack. We have created a group chat and have been relying on asynchronous communication but we will discuss organizing a synchronous meeting.

How long will it realistically take you to respond to a message?
Will you hold a regular meeting, or rely exclusively on asynchronous communication?
