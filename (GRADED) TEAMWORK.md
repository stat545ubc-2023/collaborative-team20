 ## Division of Labour
 _How will you divide the work required for this milestone? Be sure to include what work will be done individually, so that the work in each teammate‚Äôs pull request has been identified._
   
**Exercise 1: Getting Setup - complete individually** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Have one group member make a repository on GitHub; your repository should automatically be listed as part of the stat545ubc-2023 Organization
   - [x] add teammates to the repository as collaborators

**Exercise 2: Markdown Formatting - @BearAlenko, @April-UBC** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Between your README.md and TEAMWORK.md files, showcase at least five functionalities of GitHub-flavoured markdown (header, emphasis, emoji, task list, image, lists)

**Exercise 3: Merge one Pull Request per teammate - @BearAlenko, @April-UBC, @andrasszeitz, @whh1123**
   - [ ] Every teammate should submit at least one pull request - _pending @whh1123_
   - [ ] Successful merging of a complete set of pull requests
   - [ ] Comment(s) kicking off the pull request
   - [ ] Follow-up comment(s) from a reviewer
   - [ ] each teammate gets the chance to act as a reviewer/merger of someone else‚Äôs pull request - _pending @whh1123_
   - [ ] Indicated to the TAs which PRs you would like to be graded by adding ‚Äú(GRADED)‚Äù to the PR name
    
**Exercise 4: GitHub Issues - complete individually**
   - [ ] Each team member should write a new Issue introducing themselves briefly. Tag each of your teammates in the body of your Issue. _pending @whh1123_
 - [ ] Each team member should respond to everyone‚Äôs introduction Issue
   

**Exercise 5: Teamwork Contract - @April-UBC**
   - [x] Make a new document in the root of your repository called TEAMWORK.md
   - [ ] Fill in the document with guidelines as to how you will work together (must include division of labour, timing and communiation) _just pending future pull requests_

**Exercise 6: Troubleshooting document - @BearAlenko** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Put the troubleshooting-1.Rmd document in your repository
   - [x] Fix all three errors in the troubleshooting-1.Rmd document, as outlined in the document
   - [x] Knit the document to an md file (just click ‚Äúknit‚Äù in RStudio)

**Exercise 7: README file - @BearAlenko, @andrasszeitz** ‚úÖ
- [x] Your repository should already be seeded with a blank README.md file. In this file, include a brief description of the repository + project by including at least the three required elements. Your README file might be about the length of a paragraph in total.

**Exercise 8: Submitting this Milestone - @???**
- [ ] Tag a release on your GitHub repository, and adding a link to the release on canvas

## Timing

_When will you each aim to submit your pull requests, keeping in mind that another teammate will need to review your work? Warning: Do not submit your part of the project last-minute. Your teammate‚Äôs review of your work may not be trivial: if there are errors, your team will need time to debug them._

  * September 15: Exercise 5 and Exercise 6 (finished) pull and merge.
  * September 18: Updating the Teamwork Contract and finished README file.
  * _Add more dates as pull requests come in_
    

    
## Communication

_How will you communicate with each other? For example, will you be using both Slack and GitHub Issues? For what, exactly? How long will it realistically take you to respond to a message? Will you hold a regular meeting, or rely exclusively on asynchronous communication?_

  * We will aim to communicate with each other via Slack. We have created a group chat and have been relying on asynchronous communication but we will discuss organizing a synchronous meeting.
