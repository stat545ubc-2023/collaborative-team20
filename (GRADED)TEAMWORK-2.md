 ## Division of Work
 _Be sure to include what work will be done individually, so that the work in each teammate’s pull request has been identified._
 
**Exercise 0: Merge one Pull Request per teammate**  @andrasszeitz @April-UBC @BearAlenko @whh1123

In the exercise, each team member has

   - [ ] creation of a complete set of pull requests (i.e., one pull request per teammate) @andrasszeitz @BearAlenko, @April-UBC
   - [ ] reviewed a pull request made by others and merged it @April-UBC @BearAlenko @andrasszeitz
   - [ ] comment(s) kicking off the pull request @April-UBC @BearAlenko @andrasszeitz
   - [ ] follow-up comment(s) from a reviewer @April-UBC @BearAlenko @andrasszeitz
   - [ ] each teammate gets the chance to act as a reviewer/merger of someone else’s pull request
   - [ ] ensured that pull requests previously graded are marked "(GRADED)" in the file name

**Exercise 1: Troubleshooting document**  ✅ @BearAlenko

The Repository

   - [x] contains troubleshooting-2.Rmd file
   - [x] eleven errors that have been fixed and documented in the troubleshooting-2.Rmd file
   - [x] contains troubleshooting-2.md that is up-to-date with its Rmd source

**Exercise 2: README file and tidy repo**  ✅ @andrasszeitz

   - [x] README.md reflects all changes made to the repository
   - [x] Repository is clean and organized; no old files kept, with all output files being up to date.

**Exercise 3: Submitting this Milestone** 

   - [ ] Collaborative Project: Milestone 2 was tagged a release to Canvas

**Additional: TEAMWORK file and updating** ✅ @April-UBC

   - [x] Update the progress and division of work in TEAMWORK file  @April-UBC
   

## Timing

_When you will submit your pull requests, keep in mind that another teammate will need to review your work. Warning: Do not submit your part of the project last-minute; allow time for you teammate to review your work. If there are errors, your team will need time to fix the errors._

  * September 23: Exercise 1 and 2 completed.
  * September 27: Exercise 0-3 completed, tentatively
  * September 28-29: Last-minute unexpected errors, problems fixed, Exercise 3 completed.
    
## Communication

  * We will aim to communicate with each other via Slack. We have created a group chat and have been relying on asynchronous communication but we will discuss organizing a synchronous meeting.
